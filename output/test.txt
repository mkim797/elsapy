Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs are ubiquitous priority pollutants that cause great damage to the natural environment and health Average genome size in a community is critical for shedding light on microbiome’s functional response to pollution stress within an environment Here microcosms under different concentrations were performed to evaluate the selection of PAHs stress on the average genome size in a community We found the distinct communities of significantly larger genome size with the increase of PAHs concentration gradients in soils and consistent trends were discovered in soils at different latitudes The abundance of Proteobacteria and DeinococcusThermus with relatively larger genomes increased along with PAHs stress and well adapted to polluted environments In contrast the abundance of Patescibacteria with a highly streamlined and smaller genome decreased implying complex interactions between environmental selection and functional fitness resulted in bacteria with larger genomes becoming more abundant Moreover we confirmed the increased capacity for horizontal transfer of degrading genes between communities by showing an increased connection number per node positively related to the nidA gene along the concentration gradients in the cooccurrence network Our findings suggest PAHs tend to select bacterial taxa with larger genome sizes with significant consequences for community stability and potential biodegradation strategies
With the increasing popularity of new energy electric vehicles the demand for lithiumion batteries LIBs has been growing rapidly which will produce a large number of spent LIBs Therefore recycling of spent LIBs has become an urgent task to be solved otherwise it will inevitably lead to serious environmental pollution Herein a unique recycling strategy is proposed to achieve the concurrent reuse of cathode and anode in the spent graphiteLiFePO4 batteries Along with such recycling process a unique cathode composed of recycled LFPgraphite RLFPG with cationanioncostorage ability is designed for newtype dualion battery DIB As a result the recyclederived DIB of LiRLFPG is established with good electrochemical performance such as an initial discharge capacity of 1174 mA h g−1 at 25 mA g−1 and 78 capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 100 mA g−1 The working mechanism of LiRLFPG DIB is also revealed via in situ Xray diffraction and electrode kinetics studies This work not only presents a farreaching significance for largescale recycling of spent LIBs in the future but also proposed a sustainable and economical method to design newtype secondary batteries as recycling of spent LIBs
Effective lawmaking requires collaboration among legislators who form coalitions to advance their legislative agendas In this paper we explore how legislators’ party and gender identities simultaneously influence whom they choose as collaborators by examining differential party and gender homophily during a period of shifting party control and increasing representation of women in the US House of Representatives We introduce new methods for inferring legislative collaboration networks from bill cosponsorship data then estimate crosssectional logistic regression models on these networks from 1981–2018 We find evidence of differential homophily by both party and gender Republicans and women tend to prefer sameparty and samegender political collaborators more than Democrats and men However party homophily ie partisanship is stronger than gender homophily suggesting that party is a more salient identity for legislators than gender

The scientific application of stabilized materials has been considered an effective method for the in situ remediation of Cdcontaminated soil This study aimed to investigate the persistence of the effect of a combined amendment of limestone and sepiolite LS on soil Cd availability and accumulation in rice grown in a mildly Cdcontaminated paddy field 045 mgkg of Cd over three consecutive rice seasons 1125–4500 kgha of LS was applied to the soil before the first rice planting season and 5625–2250 kgha of LS was supplemented before the third rice planting season The application of LS 1125–4500 kgha increased the soil pH by 044–109 018–053 and 042–068 in the first second and third season respectively and decreased the soil acidextractable Cd content by 182–364 177–335 and 96–176 LS application significantly decreased the Cd contents in the rice tissues The application of 4500 kgha of LS decreased the Cd content in brown rice to below the National Food Limit Standard of 02 mgkg GB 27622017 in the three consecutive rice seasons However the effect of LS on the soilrice system was significantly weakened in the third season The supplementary application of 5625–2250 kgha of LS further decreased the Cd content in brown rice by 261–565 and decreased the health risk index by 237–438 Therefore it was recommended to apply 4500 kgha of LS in the first season and to supplement 2250 kgha of LS in the third season to effectively guarantee the clean production of rice in three consecutive rice seasons
Nonylphenol NP residues as a typical endocrine disrupting chemical EDC frequently exist in sewage surface water groundwater and even drinking water which poses a serious threat to human health due to its bioaccumulation In order to remove NP a series of MIL100FeZnFe2O4flakelike porous carbon nitride MILZC was synthesized through insitu synthesis at room temperature High performance of ternary MILZC is used to degrade NP under visible light irradiation The results show that 30MILZC2 20 wt ZnFe2O4 ternary composite had the best photocatalytic activity 9984 when the dosage was 30 mg Further mechanism analysis shows that the excellent photocatalytic activity of 30MILZC2 could be ascribed to the double charge transfer process between flakelike porous carbon nitride PCN and other catalysts in the ternary heterojunction and the separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs was more effective In addition the 30MILZC2 also showed high stability after five cycles of the photodegradation reaction Furthermore the active substance •O2
                     − was considered to be the main active substance in the NP degradation process Based on the research results the possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism of 30MILZC2 ternary composite was proposed and discussed in detail

                     N organic wastewater to the biological unit could cause potassium ion K accumulation thereby affecting the removal of NH4
                     N by activated sludge Thus the effects of high K stress on activated sludge nitrification performance was studied The results showed that the high K stress promoted the floc sludge to produce more extracellular polymers EPS which accelerated the sludge sedimentation and enriched the biomass in sequential batch reactors SBRs The ammonia oxidation process and nitrite NO2
                     N oxidation process were further analyzed in the nitrification process High K stress enriched ammonia oxidizing bacteria AOB which ensured the efficient ammonia oxidation process in SBRs and ensured the removal rate of NH4
                     N was maintained above 93 However high K stress 15gL KCl inhibited the activity of NO2
                     −N oxidizing bacteria NOB and reduced the abundance of NOB thus leading to the accumulation of NO2
                     −N and finally worsened the nitrification performance of activated sludge In short the performance of activated sludge will not be inhibited when the K in the wastewater does not exceed 523 gL The results could provide a reference for the optimization of the biological performance in treating highNH4
